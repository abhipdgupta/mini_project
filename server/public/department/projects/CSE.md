# Major Projects
#### Identification of Projects and Allocation Methodology to Faculty Members
1. At the beginning of 7th semester, the students are notified to form project groups consisting of not more than five members.
In case some of the students are not able to form groups, the department takes the initiative.
2. The HOD asks the faculty members to submit a list of projects mentioning the title and area of the project.
3. The compiled list is made available to the students.
4. The students can meet the faculty members to have a better understanding of the project that he or she has floated.
5. A project allocation session is held with the final year students in presence of HOD and faculty members for collecting the
choice of projects by different student groups.
6. A committee of senior faculty members scrutinizes the choices and resolve clashes if any.
7. The committee takes into account factors such as the complexity of the project, academic credentials of the students in a
group, programming proficiency of the group, etc.
8. In resolving clashes, sometimes, similar projects are allotted by a concerned faculty member if the groups are found to be
capable of carrying out the project.
9. Sometimes, certain project groups come up with their own projects. Such projects are closely scrutinized by a faculty
committee and if found suitable, the HOD asks the faculty members their willingness to act as the supervisor of the project.
The HOD allocates a supervisor from the willing faculty members taking into consideration domain knowledge and interest.

# Project Monitoring
1. The project coordinator appointed by the HOD plans the project schedule that includes the date of reviews, evaluation
methods, assessment rubrics, and report submission.
2. The project supervisor is responsible to monitor the progress of project work. He is expected to help the group in searching
resources, planning the activities, and preparing action plans to complete the work as per the academic calendar.
3. The supervisor is to meet the groups 4 hours weekly in specified project class hours to resolve problems encountered and
judge the involvement of individual group members in the project work. He needs to keep a proper record of such sittings and
the Head of the Department monitors the activities assigned to the supervisors.
