# GOOGLE DEVELOPER STUDENT CLUB

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSCs) are university based community groups for students interested in
Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in
growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer
learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.

**VISION & OBJECTIVES**

GDSC-JEC primarily works on the following three principles:

• CONNECT - Creation of an open environment where anyone can talk openly about their areas of
technical interests, irrespective of their field of study.
• LEARN - Providing consistent learning opportunities through hands-on workshops, events, talks and
project-building activities; so that students can keep in constant touch with the technological domain
they want to enter and explore and expand their field of interests.
• GROW - Applying new learnings to build great solutions for local problems.

In addition to it, we are also focused on the following:

• Work as a team while participating in global initiatives like 2022 Solution Challenge, which aims to solve
for one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals, using technology. The Solution
Challenge is open to members of Google Developer Student Clubs.
•Strengthen the members' network by connecting and collaborating with people from all around the
globe, which is possible due to the presence of Google Developer Student Clubs in 100+ countries.
•Catalyze the members' professional growth by providing them the required experience to work with
experts in their respective fields.

**AIM FOR THE ACADEMIC YEAR 2022-23**:

•Compose Camp: Community-organized events focused around how to build Android apps using Jetpack
Compose, where attendees get hands-on coding experience with Compose.
• 30 Days of Google Cloud: A program to have an opportunity to kickstart one's career in cloud computing
and get hands-on practice on Google Cloud Platform - the tool that powers apps like Google Search,
Gmail and YouTube.
•Flutter Fest: A community led event series where developers can join to learn the fundamentals of
Google technologies - featuring Flutter, Firebase and Google Cloud content.
• TensorFlow Everywhere: TensorFlow Everywhere is a series of global events on Al/ML led by TensorFlow
and machine learning communities around the world.
• 2022 Solutions Challenge: The mission of the 2022 Solution Challenge is to solve for one or more of the
United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals using Google technology. The Solution Challenge is
