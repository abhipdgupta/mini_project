By far it has been the most active Club of Jorhat Engineering College as it happens to be an inexplicable
part of the socio-cultural structure of the college by itself. The administration of JEC and Student Union of
the college JECSU has always entrusted the responsibility of "Photography" and "Videography" to this Club
and the Club itself has tried to meet the expectations with sincerity and utmost dedication over the years.
FotoKraft is always willing to improve itself and garner skills for the better of the college and its
counterparts.

Besides that the other activities of the clubs include photo-shootouts, holding photography-
workshops,competitions, seminars and photo exhibitions. The club has its own photo gallery in the college
premises which displays the immense talent of its members. Along with that, FotoKraft works in tandem
with other Clubs of JEC to provide the best means possible of representation of the college for the greater
good.
