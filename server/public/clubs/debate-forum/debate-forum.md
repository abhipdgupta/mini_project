# About
The *JEC Debating Society*, which was founded in 2016, is undoubtedly one of the most successful societies
of our college. Comprising of around 30 members from all departments, its primary focus is towards taking
part in two kinds of debates, the Parliamentary form and the Conventional form. We understand that skills
like elocution can come with practice, which is why that isn't our main focus. What we do focus on instead is
the ability to think, analyze, how to argue, how to structure arguments and how to build our knowledge
base. We aim to make the debaters the best in terms of how well they argue and how convincing they are.
We aim to create an atmosphere conducive to learning and a platform that allows for free debate, discussion
and airing of all opinions. Apart from the several debates organized during various occasions in our college
this society also conducts 'Mantrana' which is the Inter-Institutional Debate organized during our techno-
cultural festival 'Phoenix' and is extremely popular among debate enthusiasts across the state. We
participate in debates all across the state, right from the debates organized by the various organizations to
the debates held by other engineering colleges as well as other colleges across the state.

**President of the club** - Yeasin Ahmed

**Core members** - Gargi Thakuria, Ritwick Parashar and Aditya Ojjha
