# About
The Jorhat Engineering College GNU/Linux Users Group, or the JEC GLUG upholds the international
tradition of having a computer users' group in a technical college. Its objectives are simple: advocate use of
free and open source software along with GNU/Linux, computer education, expert technical support, and
socialising among computer enthusiasts. Since its inception in 2013, JEC GLUG has organised numerous
events, some of which are as follows:
1. Install fests: Mass installations of GNU/Linux in students' computers, thus enabling them to further their
computing skills.
2. Seminars on getting started with GNU/Linux, demonstrations of latest technologies and security issues.
3. Regular classes on particular topics, such as shell scripting.
4. Competitions and exams.
GLUG stands for GNU - Linux users group, as the name suggests this group was created because people
united with their common interest for linux and open source software in general. Founded in 2013 under the
supervision of Mr. Rajib Chakrabartty Sir we are proud to be one the very first group of its kind in the entire
region of jorhat and upper assam. Now in addition to Linux we explore many different and popular branches
of computer science that are in demand today.
