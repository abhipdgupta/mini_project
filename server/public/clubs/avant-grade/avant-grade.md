> _When I say artist I mean the one who is building things...some with a brush-some with a shovel-some choose a pen. ~ Jackson Pollock_



Rightly said by Sir Jackson Pollock, infamous American painter, choosing the brush, here in Jorhat
Engineering College, Jorhat few of many of the artistic minds came together to form 'Avant Garde. As the
name suggests, innovative and futuristic, Avant Garde gives a broad spectrum to those budding artists who
have a knack for art and activities related to creating art; those who dare to go beyond the usual aesthetics
of art . Be it painting, sculpture making, crafts work ,poster making, Avant Garde, gives a platform to the
artistic minds to come forward and enhance their talents and take their dreams of creating art to a new
level.
