# About
The Greek Philosopher Aristotle writes ..If every tool ,when ordered or even of its own accord ,could do the
work that befits it .. then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers or of slaves
for the lords." hinting how nice it would be to have few robots around.
The *robotics club* of JEC is a student-run club on campus with an active participation of around 100
students. Our club was initiated in the year 2010.We bring together like-minded students from all the
departments in our college to have fun building robots. JEC Roboworld provides an opportunity for students
to supplement their education with hands-on experience in integration engineering. It offers indispensible
guidance, workshops and tutorials along with tools, equipments, components and workspace. The family
meets periodically to discuss over matters such as the management of the workspace, workshops, projects
and competitions. We welcome anyone, with or without prior knowledge, who wishes to be a part of this
fraternity. We firmly believe in working in a planned, organized and disciplined manner that helps us in risk
free management. The proceedings of the club are all pre-planned and run smoothly according to the rules.
Well defined goals, an organized and disciplined work structure and motivated members are the features of
the club that have helped the club to grow to a level where we see it now. The club today is an active
platform for students to display and develop their practical machine building skills and knowledge.

## Phoenix 2022

### AEROWORK
**Event Description:-**
Two day workshop on Aero Modelling on 14 th and 15 th May was held at Jorhat Engineering College during
Phoenix by RoboWorld in collaboration with Aero Modellers Club Of Assamand 51 Assam Air Sqn (
Tech)NCC. The workshop is dedicated to learn the technology behind making of aircrafts. On the very first
day Air Show was organised in the JEC main field at 9 am then inauguration of aero modelling workshop at
10 am in Mechanical Drawing Lab of JEC was done . First day of the workshop focused on the briefing and
theory on aero modelling from 10 am to 10: 30 am, assembling and construction of aero model from 10:30
am to 11:30 am, then a tea break from 11:30am to 12pm, cutting and pasting of the model from 12 pm to 1:30
pm then lunch break from 1:30 pm -2:30 pm, assembling and construction from 2:30 pm - 7 pm.Model
aircraft are small sized flying replicas of existing of imaginary aircraft using a variety of materials including
paper, tapes, foam board, coroplast sheet, propeller, wood pieces, glue, metal wire etc for the body and
the electronicsconfiguration of the model covered servos, jumper wires , brushless DC motor, electronic
speed controller, LiPo battery, receiver and remote etc. Second day of the workshop focused on setting
and programming of aircraft and mounting of electronics from 10 am, designing and decoration of aero
model from 12 pm and at the end the aero model kit were tested in the JEC main field from 4pm. The
workshop helped the participants to get brief knowledge on the basic concepts of Aerodynamics,
Propulsion, Flight mechanics, structure and concepts of electronics involved in C aircraft technology. The
workshop duration was ten hours during the first day and six hours during the second day and certificate of
participation was provided to all.
