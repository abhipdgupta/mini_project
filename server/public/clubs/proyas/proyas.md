"*PROYAS*", the voluntary welfare society, of Jorhat Engineering College was incepted in 2012 with the noble
aim of disseminating the idea of upliftment of the social and moral responsibility of JOENCOVITES,
envisioning the greater perspective of laying the foundation for a better tomorrow. As the name suggests,
Proyas is an endeavour *of the students, by the students, for the students (for the entire JEC family to be
more appropriate!)" to promote a cleaner and greener campus and to revive the sense of responsibility and
consciousness among the students. Team Proyas has been tenaciously working towards eradicating social
evils and fostering civic and moral responsibilities of the students and the entire JEC fraternity alike. It has
initiated several cleanliness drives and plantation programmes and various other events in the
campus under its banner. With the ever increasing zest and enthusiasm of the philanthropists of Jorhat
Engineering College, it is hoped Proyas shall continue to spread its aura of goodwill.
