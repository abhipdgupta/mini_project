# About
Engineering education begins with essential knowledge and applications of basics of physics and chemistry.
Along with inception of Jorhat Engineering College in 1960, the Department of Chemistry also came into
existence in the existing Assam Type building now under occupation of N.C.C. The founder HOD was Late
Kamrooz Zaman and Dulal Chandra Barua was demonstrator. But it was shifted to the ground floor of the
main building in1965 and is still functioning with 72 student's capacities. The subsequent HODs are
Ramapada Patra, Amulya Baruah, Dr. Munin Ghosh, D.P.S Thakur, Dr. Bhogeswar Saikia, Dr. Ranjumoni
Saikia, Dr. Bhabani Kanta Sarmah. At present the department has two experienced and dedicated regular
faculty members along with two young faculty members under TEQIP III.
The Department is well- equipped with modern sophisticated Instrumentation facilities such as, Double
beam U.V. Visible Spectrophotometer, Atomic absorption spectrophotometer, Digital PH-meter, Deionizer,
D.O. meter, Portable water analyzing kit, Electronic balance etc. We also carried out any type of water and
soil analysis required for different project works. We also undertake water and soil sample for analysis from
outside. Recently laboratory is developed under MODROBS project funded by AICTE, New Delhi during
2007-2008. It can provide consultancy services. The faculties also help Instrumentation Engineering
Department in addition to normal classes. The department also provides facilities to B.E. and M.E. students
in undergoing project work wherever needs.
