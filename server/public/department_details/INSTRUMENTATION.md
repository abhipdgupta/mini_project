# About

The North Eastern region of India is abundant in natural resources like petroleum, natural gas, coal, limestone and other minor minerals such as magnetic quartzite, clay etc. Furthermore, Assam is also the largest producer of tea in India. In that capacity, so as to take care of the demand of Instrumentation Engineers in these industries, Instrumentation Engineering Department was established in the year 1992 with an intake capacity of 20 students in Jorhat Engineering College, with JEC turning into the main
institute in N.E area of the nation to offer four years B.E programme in Instrumentation Engineering. The courses are approved by AICTE, New Delhi. In the year 2009, AICTE has approved to increase the intake capacity of Instrumentation Engineering to 30. The courses are affiliated under Dibrugarh University, Assam and Assam Science and Technology University (AST), Assam. The department admits the students into the programme through a Common Entrance Examination and Lateral Entry through Lateral Entrance Examination conducted by the Government of Assam. The department has strength of one Professor, two Associate Professors and four Assistant Professors. The faculties are specialized in Instrumentation, Power System, Control System, MEMS Devices, Biomedical
Signal Processing and Embedded Systems. The department is well equipped with modern laboratory facilities and computer centre. The course structure and syllabi of the subjects are modified at a regular interval of time to incorporate the recent developments in science & technology. Moreover, the department also gives emphasis to incorporate all the topics which are included in the syllabi of different all India level competitive examinations such as GATE, IES, IAS etc.
