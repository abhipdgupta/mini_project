**Highway construction falls again, gets off to a poor start in FY2024**

New Delhi: Highway construction in April fell 75% sequentially to just over 500 km, according to data from the ministry of road transport and highways, marking a poor start to the government’s road-building target for the year.

By contrast, 2,250 km of highways were laid down in March, which could be the result of government agencies rushing to hit the target at the close of the financial year. The April numbers raise concerns that road construction targets may be missed for the third consecutive year in FY24 in the run up to the general election.

The data showed only about 523 km of highways were been built in April, 2023, at just 17.4 km per day as against a target of over 45 km per day in FY24. The April road work is even lower than the 578 km of highways built in April 2022 after the third wave of the pandemic.

“The highway construction work continues to be plagued by delays in land acquisition at the state level. Most often road projects are taken up by contractors without full clearance (90% as mandated) and this creates hurdles in starting work resulting in lower highway construction as seen for the past couple of years," said P C Grover, director general, National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF).
