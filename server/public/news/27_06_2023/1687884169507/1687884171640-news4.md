# Sensing the world around us

**MIT.nano symposium highlights applications of ambient sensing.**

Ambient Sensing highlighted sensing technologies from several MIT labs and departments. Pictured on the left is Associate Professor Ruonan Han’s reflectarray, which can precisely focus a beam of terahertz energy on a tiny area and control it rapidly with no moving parts. At right is Associate Professor Fadel Adib’s underwater sensor that reduces its energy consumption by reflecting acoustic signals, rather than generating its own.

“Sensing is all around you,” said MIT.nano Associate Director Brian W. Anthony at Ambient Sensing, a half-day symposium presented in May by the MIT.nano Immersion Lab. Featuring MIT faculty and researchers from multiple disciplines, the event highlighted sensing technologies deployed everywhere from beneath the Earth’s surface to high into the exosphere.

Brent Minchew, assistant professor in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), kicked off the symposium with a presentation on using remote sensing to understand the flow, deformation, and fracture of glacier ice, and how that is contributing to sea level rise. “There’s this fantastic separation of scales,” said Minchew. “We’re taking observations collected from satellites that are flying 700 kilometers above the surface, and we’re using the data that’s collected there to infer what’s happening at the atomic scale within the ice, which is magnificent.”
