> *"Magic is believing in yourself; if you can do that, you can make anything happen"- this is the real practical thought upon which the focus of the JEC hostel 7 boarders are surrounded. Result may be anything, but to be honest, in the process of delivering a fruitful outcome, the hostel is always undefeated. "The Maker" of many respected person's lives, the Hostel 7 of Jorhat Engineering College was established in the year 1982 and obviously the boarders were able to make the hostel's silver jubilee in 2009 in an ornamented fashion. Academically successful, the hostel has also gained the respected vision on and off the field of college events. The hostel wall magazine heading a title "Arunabh" is the tool of boarder's experienced reflection.The hostel is carrying the name- "ORION" now, whose birthname was "The north-east house". For the boarders, for the orionites it can be said-" We are not known by names but by a race"-ORlONlTE-warriors within.*
